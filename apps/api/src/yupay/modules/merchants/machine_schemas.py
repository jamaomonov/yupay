"""Pydantic DTOs for the machine API — the ``/merchant/v1`` wire contract.

These are a **third-party contract**: a reseller's server parses them and
nobody but its owner can redeploy it, so a field may be added but never
renamed, retyped or removed — that needs ``/merchant/v2``. They are
documented for integrators in this module's README, and they live apart from
``schemas.py`` (the admin SPA's DTOs, which we redeploy with the API) so the
difference in what a change costs is visible from the file name.

JSON string, never a float.
