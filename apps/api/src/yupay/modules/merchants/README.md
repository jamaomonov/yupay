# `merchants`

B2B reseller accounts: a merchant, its cabinet operator(s), and the API keys
its server uses against `/merchant/v1`. This is the schema module that every
other part of the merchant B2B feature (the machine API, the cabinet BFF, the
deposit ledger, admin) builds on.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-merchant-b2b-design.md`

## Terminology note

Acquirers call **us** the merchant (Click/Payme `merchant_id` credentials);
in this module the merchant is the reseller.

## Tables

- `merchants` — the reseller account: `title`, `status` (`active`/`frozen`),
  and a dormant `markup_adjustment_pp` reserved for a future per-merchant
  pricing override (spec §8.3).
- `merchant_users` — cabinet operators. One user per merchant in v1; the FK
  already permits more.
- `merchant_api_keys` — machine credentials for `/merchant/v1`: a public
  `key_id` (`ypm_`-prefixed) and a SHA-256 `secret_hash`, with an optional
  IP allowlist.

This task lays the schema only — no service, routes, or auth yet.
